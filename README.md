# IGME106-FinalProject

A 2-month, 4 person project for Game Dev & Algorithmic Problem Solving IGME 106.

This project was created using the Monogame framework, the Penumbra lighting framework, and C#.
The level editor was created using Windows Forms.

## The Game

Our concept was for a horror where the player explores a dark, top-down environment using only a directional flashlight and glowsticks. Their goal is to turn on the generator and then escape the map without being caught. Roaming the map are a number of giant spider enemies that will chase the player upon making contact.

## Project Breakdown

Idea generation and gameplay development was done through group effort and communication, and the model of the game changed as we worked on it based on input from each individual. A breakdown of major features is as follows:

Physics system - Arthur
Art Assets/Enemy AI - Runi
Sound Design/Level Editor - Nick
Flashlight/Final Objective - Ciyu
